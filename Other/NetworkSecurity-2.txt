protocols & devices

application - layer 7
ftp, tftp, bootp, snmp, rlogin, smtp, mime, finger, telnet, ncp, ssh, afp, smb, http, api
* Gateways and Proxy Servers doing conversions

presentation - layer 6
ASCII, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, MPEG, MIDI - Universal format

session - layer 5
netbios, nfs, sql, rpc

transport - layer 4
tcp, udp, ssl, tls (port #s create sockets)

network - layer 3 (routers)
ipv4, ipv6, icmp, rip, igmp, ospf, bgp

data link - layer 2
slip, ppp, arp, rarp, l2f, l2tp, pptp
ethernet, token ring, x.25, frame relay, atm
* Bridges, switches - two sublayers llc & nac

physical - layer 1
high-speed serial interface (hssi), x.21, eia/tia-232, eia/tia-449, sonet
* amplifiers, repeaters, hubs, media - Patch Panels

most weak on layer 1-2
3-5 good
6, 7 harder to secure

tools
port scanners
packet sniffers
network scanners
ids - (packet sniffer with rules applied to it)
ips 

Port Scanners
Used to identify what ports are listening on os to accept service connections
identify potential weaknesses in networks, identifies what's open & available
Scanning tools Perform portscans first to start vulnerability ID process
Tools:
Nmap
Strobe

Packet & Network sniffers
operate at layers 2-3 of OSI model
examine traffic in real-time
capture & log packets across a network
follow pcap format
Tools: 
TCPDump - best
Tehthereal
Tcpslice
tcpreplay
ngrep
wireshark - best
netdude

network scanners
argus, wireshark, nessus, retina, appscan, sara, saint (SCAP based outputs)

firewall
access control component which allows/denies traffic between two networks
filters based on ip addr & domain, packet header or content, services, ports, protocols
	- domain & access to outside
	- admin domains of dissimilar policy
	- networks where boundary must be controlled

Combination of software & hardware
different levels
Commonly placed at network perimeter (restricts access from one network to another)
Host-based firewalls shield systems from others on LAN using separate software or OS firewall
Access control mechanism & filters traffic
Filters mac addresses
ACL - Access Control Lists
Filter or forward based on source & destination IP addr & port #s in packet headers

Static Packet Filter Firewall
Simple & fast method to stop unwanted or incoming traffic
examines header for ip addr, ports, protocol type to compare its ACL
minimum security for low-risk environments
screening routers with rules for accepting or rejecting data based on ACL
Cannot keep session state information
All outgoing traffic is allowed

Dynamic Stateful Firewall
Keeps track of state or dialog process of a communication stream between internal & external hosts
