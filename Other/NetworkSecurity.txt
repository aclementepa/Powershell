Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
a means of restricting access to system resources based on the 
sensitivity (as represented by a label) of the information 
contained in the system resource and the clearance of users 
to access that information

Users are given an access level and are only allowed to view object at (and somtiiemses below)


Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
A means of restricting access to objects where the owner of the object has full control
and is able to change the permissions of other users as they pertain to the object and its
data

Changed at owner's discretion

Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)
- access-control approach in which access is given based on attributes 
associated with requesters and the objects to be accessed

- each object and subject has a set of associated attributes, such as location,
time of creation, or access rights and access to an object is granted or denied
depending upon whether the attributes of the requester match those required for
access

- provides a greater selection of control options than other access control methods

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- A model for controlling access to resources where actions are permitted on
resources based on requestoor roles rather than individual identities

- Similar to the DAC model, but with more flexibility. Only administrators can
modify access permissions, and users are assigned to various groups known as "roles"
which each provide the right to access certain files

Rule-Basased Access Control
A security policy which is based on global rules determined by a system-wide policy
and imposed for all subjects is a type of Rule-Based Access Control

- Individual users are not able to change object permissions, and must follow the 
policy rules

- MAC, RBAC (Role-Based), and ABAC can all be considered methods of Rule-based
